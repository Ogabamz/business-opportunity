# Directory Overview

This directory contains a static website for a recruitment and sales funnel. The funnel is aimed at recruiting individuals for a "Forever Living" business opportunity, mentored by "Coach May". The page is styled using Tailwind CSS and is designed to guide a user to an application/lead capture form.

# Key Files

*   `merged.html`: This is the main, comprehensive sales page. It combines the story of the mentor, details the business opportunity ("Forever Living"), includes testimonials, and has a detailed application form for joining the mentor's team. This is the primary page of the funnel.

*   `*.jpg` files (`coachmay.jpg`, `collage.jpg`, `foreverlivinglogo.jpg`, `testimonialsales.jpg`): These are the image assets used in the `merged.html` page to add visual appeal, branding, and proof of success.

# Usage

The `merged.html` file is meant to be viewed in a web browser. It serves as a direct sales and application page to convert a prospect into a business partner.

The form on the page uses Formspree (`https://formspree.io/f/mvgkwgez`) to handle submissions, capturing lead information like name, address, and WhatsApp number.
